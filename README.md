# Recommendation-System-For-Book-Lovers
This was my final project for the All Women AI Applied Bootcamp, which included AWS technologies to deploy the model.
This project contains two notebooks: one for data preprocessing and cleaning, and another for model training and the expected output 
Today Iâ€™m presenting a recommendation system that predicts wich books certain users are likely to enjoy, based on their previous interactions, such as book reviews and ratings. Because, as a wise old lady always says, reading is fundamental.
Kudos to Abhishek Thakur for his Goodreads autotrain notebook, which contains the dataset used for this project:
